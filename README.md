# Ebay Price Check

At my current job, working at a local scrapyard, we sometimes need to know the value of specific cars or car parts on short notice using ebay. This is an app I have developed to speed up this process by using ebay auctions and calculating the average price of items that have sold.

A demo of this app is available here: [ebaypricecheck.herokuapp.com](https://ebaypricecheck.herokuapp.com)
